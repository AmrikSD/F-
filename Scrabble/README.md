## Exercise - Scrabble

Given a word, write a function to compute the Scrabble score for that word.

You will need the following:

| Letter                       | Score |
| ---------------------------- | ----- |
| A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T | 1     |
| D, G                         | 2     |
| B, C, M, P                   | 3     |
| F, H, V, W, Y                | 4     |
| K                            | 5     |
| J, X                         | 8     |
| Q, Z                         | 10    |

Example "cabbage" would be worth 14 points.

Potentially extend it to be able to specify a double or triple letter, and be able to specify a double or triple word.
